You can find the **source code** for several example
games that are already live on **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** at this github repository:

https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples

We recommend continuing to read these short docs to understand the key pieces of
building a xelly.games game, but the above examples can be a great place to
learn more or copy patterns to get started with your own games.

Feel free to clone, fork, and extend these example games to your heart's content.
