Games on xelly.games are
[sandboxed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#sandbox)
via `<iframe allow-scripts .../>`.

All this means is that the TypeScript/Javascript of your game is limited in what
it can do. This includes not being able to make network calls, use `fetch`,
form `POST`, etc.

It also means you can't:

- Access cookies or local storage from the parent domain
- Access the parent window or its DOM
- Create new windows or popups
- Use browser features that require permissions (geolocation, notifications, etc.)
- Manipulate the URL fragment or history

:::warning
Because you can't make network calls from your code, your entire game must be
deployed as a
[_single_ built file](../build-a-game/create-your-project.mdx#rollupconfigmjs), and
any resources such as graphics, sprites, spritesheets, fonts, etc. must be
bundled into the built output file (typically, `bundle.js`).

See [Images and Fonts](./images-and-fonts) for how to compile sprites and fonts
into your games.
