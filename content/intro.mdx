# Welcome

This page describes how to build a game for **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)**, a unique
social network experience in which users submit **_"micro games"_** (games less than
300kb in size) instead of, say, "tweets", videos, or images.

For example, here are two games among many you may find in your xelly.games feed.
The source code for these games and more are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples):

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '10px', flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>
<EmbeddedGame
        width={412}
        src={urlGameSudoku}/>

    <EmbeddedGame
        width={412}
        src={urlGameBreakout}/>
</div>
