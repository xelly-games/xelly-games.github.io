For security reasons, games running on xelly.games are
[**sandboxed**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#sandbox) &#185;.

This means that your game code is limited in what
it can do with browser resources.

Most importantly, this includes it not being able to
make network calls (use `fetch`, form `POST`, etc).

It also means it can't:

- Access cookies or local storage from the parent domain
- Access the parent window or its DOM
- Create new windows or popups
- Use browser features that require permissions (geolocation, notifications, etc.)
- Manipulate the URL fragment or history

:::warning
Because you can't make network calls from your code, your entire game must be
deployed as a
[_single_ build file](../build-a-game/create-your-project.mdx#rollupconfigmjs), and
any resources such as graphics, sprites, spritesheets, fonts, etc. must be
bundled into the built output file (`bundle.js`).

See [Game Resources](./images-and-fonts) for how to use custom sprites and fonts
and compile them into your games.
