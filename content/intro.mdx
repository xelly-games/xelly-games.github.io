**[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** (pronounced "ZELLY" games) is a social network where, instead of "tweets",
videos, or images, our users post **games** &mdash; or "micro" games, rather:
simple, readily playable games that friends and users can interact with
directly from a scrollable feed.


For example, below you can find two simple games served directly from
the xelly.games platform. (The source code for these games and others is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples), and if you'd like to
see them in a scrollable feed, you can head over to
[xelly.games](https://xelly.games) and sign in.)

In these docs you'll learn how to create your own games
and then post them &mdash; so you can reach other xelly.games users with your genius
interactive creations!

Let's goooo! 🚀🚀🚀
