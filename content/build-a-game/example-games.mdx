The source code for several
games that are already live on xelly.games is available
[this github repository](https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples).

We recommend reading these short docs to understand the key pieces of
building a game for xelly.games, but the above examples can be a great place to
learn more or copy patterns to get started with your own games.

Feel free to clone, fork, and extend those examples &mdash; and upload them to
xelly.games for other users to play!
