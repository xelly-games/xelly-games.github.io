Making a game for **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** is hella fun!

But, wait! What _is_ **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)**?

Well, it's a **social network** of sorts &mdash; but instead of "tweets", videos, or
images, our users post **"micro games"**: i.e., simple, readily playable games that
our friends can interact with directly from a scrollable feed.

[//]: # (xelly.games is a place for people to exist with other users, play and interact)

[//]: # (among users of all stripes without tripping into toxic content, political,)

[//]: # (explicit or otherwise. It's all about interactivity and fun, and the platform)

[//]: # (is evolving regularly.)

For example, below you can find two games served directly from the platform. (The source code for these games and others is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples).)

Here, you'll learn how to **create** your own games and **submit** them &mdash;
reaching other xelly.games users with your genius creations!

Let's rock &amp; roll. 🚀🚀🚀
