    <span>Lifecycle Events</span>
</h1>

When your game is loaded into a user's feed on xelly.games, your `install`
function is called. But your game should also respond to certain lifecycle
events:

### `xelly:enter`

While scrolling their feed, xelly.games users tap (or, on desktops, _click_) to "enter" a game
and start playing it.

`xelly:enter` is emitted on the game `Engine` _by the platform_ when the user first taps or click
on the game in their feed.

In the [breakout example game](https://xelly.games/game/2043d642-a556-480e-be5a-8541f8fc147a) this is used to start the ball moving when
the user enters the game for the first time:

```typescript
    ...
    engine.once('xelly:enter', ((coords: GlobalCoordinates) => {
        if (coords.worldPos.x < engine.drawWidth / 2) {
            ball.start('left');
        } else {
            ball.start('right');
        }
    }) as Handler<any>);
    ...
```

### `xelly:terminate`

This events is emitted _by your game_ on the game `Engine`
when the game has reached a terminal state &mdash; such as a win or
loss state.

```typescript
    ...
    // always emit 'xelly:terminate' when the game is over, win or lose
    if (isGameWon) {
        showMessagePanel('You win!');
        engine.emit('xelly:terminate');
    } else if (isGameLost) {
        showMessagePanel('You lose!');
        engine.emit('xelly:terminate');
    }
    ...
```

:::warning
If your game is a turn-based or realtime game, **you must emit this event** when the
game reaches a win or loss state!

This is how the xelly.games
platform knows when to enable certain controls that allow your user to restart/replay
the game, for example.
:::

### `xelly:start`

This event is emitted on the game `Engine` _by the platform_ when the game has finished loading and
initializing (but before a user taps to enter the game play). This event is not
commonly used, so you can generally ignore it if you don't have a good use for it.
