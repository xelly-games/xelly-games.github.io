There are two ways you can test your game as you develop it:

* `npm run watch:live`
  * Starts a local development server and opens your game in a browser with hot-reloading enabled
* https://xelly.games/utility
  * Requires manual upload of `dist/bundle.js` whenever you change it, but may be useful
    when you are testing your game with browser [devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode)

### Using `npm run watch:live`

If you created your `package.json` per [these instructions](../build-a-game/create-your-project#packagejson),
then you can run:

```bash
$ npm run watch:live
```

This will open a browser window with your game running in it. The game will automatically
reload whenever you make changes to your game's source code.

### Using xelly.games/utility

1. While actively coding, build your game in "watch mode":

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

2. As you make code changes, the game will automatically rebuild `dist/bundle.js`.
You can upload this file to [xelly.games/utility](https://xelly.games/utility)
to test your changes out as you develop. (You will have to re-upload the `bundle.js`
each time you want test new changes. Note that the utility tool is a local-only tool;
your game is _not_ uploaded by this tool to xelly.games or anywhere else.)

3. When your game is live and running on a social feed, `console.log` is disabled, but the
   utility tool _will_ allow logs to the console which may be helpful for debugging
   your game as you develop it.

4. Once you're happy with your game, you can [submit it](./submitting) from your profile.
