Before we build a game, we need to set our project up. This part is easy.

Start by creating a new directory with just three files:

```
your-game-project/
    package.json
    rollup.config.mjs
    tsconfig.json
```

(If you don't already have [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
and `npm` installed, make sure you **[install them](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
before proceeding.)

Here are the three project files you'll need at the root of your project directory:

## `package.json`

The only thing you need to change here is the `name` field:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "<Your Game Name here>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf dist dist/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && echo 'cleaned!'",
    "build:tsc": "tsc --build --noEmit",
    "build:rollup": "rollup -c",
    "build": "npm run clean && npm run build:rollup",
    "watch": "rollup -c --watch",
    "watch:live": "concurrently \"npm run watch\" \"xelly-dev dist/bundle.js --port=3001 --open\""
  },
  "files": [],
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "excalibur": "0.30.3",
    "@xelly/xelly.js": "2.0.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve": "^16.0.0",
    "@rollup/plugin-terser": "^0.4.4",
    "@rollup/plugin-typescript": "^12.1.2",
    "@xelly/dev-tool": "^0.0.2",
    "concurrently": "^9.2.1",
    "rollup": "^4.30.1",
    "tslib": "^2.8.1",
    "typescript": "~5.7.3"
  }
}
```

:::tip
☝️ Make sure to run **`npm install`** in your project directory after
creating this `package.json` file.

### Dependencies

Note that we've started out with two `"dependencies"`:

- `excalibur` (`0.30.3`)
- `@xelly/xelly.js` (`2.0.3`)

Our games are built on top of [ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com)
(an excellent, versatile game engine) and
[xelly.js](https://github.com/xelly-games/xelly.js) is the official SDK for xelly.games.

:::tip
These two are required, but you can add other third-party dependencies as
long as your final game (i.e., `bundle.js` file) is no larger
than `500kb` (the current size limit for games uploaded to
xelly.games).

Note that the `500kb` limit does not include the size
of the `excalibur` library and `@xelly/xelly.js`, which are not
bundled into your game as they are provided at runtime by the
xelly.games platform.
:::

## `rollup.config.mjs`

This file is important.

We use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle our game into _**a single output
file**_ (`bundle.js`; an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) module, to be specific)
that you will upload to **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** when you are
ready to post your game.

You can copy this file exactly as-is:

```js title="rollup.config.mjs"
import typescript from '@rollup/plugin-typescript';
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import terser from '@rollup/plugin-terser';

// leave all of this exactly as-is
export default {
    input: 'src/main.ts',
    external: ['excalibur', '@xelly/xelly.js'],
    plugins: [typescript(), resolve()],
    output: {
        file: 'dist/bundle.js',
        format: 'iife',
        name: 'Game',
        globals: {
            'excalibur': 'Excal',
            '@xelly/xelly.js': 'Xelly'
        },
        plugins: [terser()]
    }
};
```

:::note
We configure Rollup here to **"externalize"** the `excalibur` and `@xelly/xelly.js`
dependencies so that they are not included in the final `bundle.js` file. These
dependencies are provided at runtime by the xelly.games platform.
:::

## `tsconfig.json`

This file can also be copied as-is:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

That's it!

With these three files in our project's root directory, we're ready to start coding our game!
