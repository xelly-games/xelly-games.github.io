# Welcome

Making a game for **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** is super simple!

But, first, what the heck is xelly.games?

Well, it's a **social network** of sorts &mdash; but instead of "tweets", videos, or
images, users post **"micro games"**: i.e., short, readily playable games that users can
interact with directly from a scrollable feed.

xelly.games is a place for people to exist with other users, play and interact
among users of all stripes without tripping into toxic content, political,
explicit or otherwise. It's all about interactivity and fun, and the platform
is evolving regularly.

For two short examples, below you can find two games served directly from the
platform. (The source code for these games and more are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/xelly-games/game-examples).)

Now's the part where you come in!

This site documents how to create your own games and submit them to xelly.

Let's get going!

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '10px', flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>
<EmbeddedGame
        width={412}
        src={urlGameSudoku}/>

    <EmbeddedGame
        width={412}
        src={urlGameBreakout}/>
</div>
