    <span>The `main.ts` File</span>
</h1>

Let's explain each section of our `main.ts` file.

## Imports

First, our `import` statements:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
import * as xel from '@xelly/xelly.js';
import {
    XellyContext,
    XellyGameType,
    XellyInstallFunction,
    XellyMetadata
} from '@xelly/xelly.js';
import {Color, Engine, Font, FontUnit, Label, vec} from 'excalibur';

// ...
```

Note:

- We can import the full extent of classes from
[ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com) to build out our games.
- `import * as xel` is the proper way to import the [xelly.js](https://github.com/xelly-games/xelly.js) library
utilities.
- `import {XellyContext, ...}` is the proper way to import the xelly.js library types.

## Metadata

The **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)** platform needs to know a few things
about your game in order to render it properly in a feed.

Therefore, all games must export a `metadata` object:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
// ...

/** Metadata. */
export const metadata: XellyMetadata = {
    type: XellyGameType.Passive
};

// ...
```

Here, we indicate that the `type` of game is a **"passive"** game, i.e., that
it is not interactive. Since this was our "Hello World" example, there's
no interactivity yet, so `XellyGameType.Passive` is the correct choice here.

The other types are:

- `XellyGameType.TurnBased`
  - This is for games that are played in a **turn-based** fashion; board, card/solitaire
    games, for example. The xelly.games platform allows `TurnBased` games to accept
    touch/click events, but a pause button won't be rendered for these games.
- `XellyGameType.Realtime`
  - This is for **"action"-like games** that are played in real-time (e.g., flappy
    bird, breakout, arcade style games, etc). A pause button will be rendered 
    for these games, and these games will be auto-paused if a user
    scrolls away "mid play". These games also can "terminate" (for example, if 
    the player character dies) and users will then be able to restart the game.
- `XellyGameType.Interactive`
  - Interactive games are less common. These are games that are action-oriented
    like realtime games but that do not never terminate (i.e., reach a win or
    lose state).

## The `install` function

All games must export an `install` function.

The **[xelly.games](https://xelly.games)**
platform will call this function when the game is loaded (or when the user
requests to reset/restart the game).

- An [ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com) `engine` instance is passed to this
  function. You will never instantiate an `Engine` instance yourself.
  The platform will configure and install one for you before `install`-ing
  your game.
- In our "Hello World" example, we only add a single `Entity` to the engine, a
  `Label` that says "Hello, world!". We do a little simple math
  to center the `Label` on the screen:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
// ...

/** Install. */
export const install: XellyInstallFunction = (context: XellyContext, engine: Engine) => {
    const message = "Hello, world!";
    const messageDimensions = font24.measureText(message);
    engine.add(new Label({
        text: "Hello, world!",
        font: font24,
        pos: vec(
            (engine.drawWidth - messageDimensions.width) / 2,
            (engine.drawHeight - messageDimensions.height) / 2),
    }));
};

// ...
```

That's it for "Hello World"!

If you are familiar with [ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com), you could start
building out your game from here.

However, you'll probably want to explore these platform-specific topics before
you publish your first game:
