Here's a workflow for developing and testing your game.

1. While actively coding, build your game in "watch mode":

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

2. As you make code changes, the game will automatically rebuild `dist/bundle.js`.
You can upload this file to [**xelly.games/utility**](https://xelly.games/utility)
to test your changes out. You'll have to re-upload it each time you want refresh
it. (Note that this is a local-only tool; your game is not uploaded by this tool
to xelly.games or anywhere else.)

3. When your game is live and running on a social feed, `console.log` is disabled, but the
   utility tool _will_ allow logs to the console which may be helpful for debugging
   your game as you develop it.

4. Once you're happy with your game, you can [submit it](./submitting) from your profile.
