At some point, you'll want to update and/or fix one of your games after it's been submitted
and approved &mdash; i.e., to fix a bug, add some nice animations or transitions,
improve the user experience, or just make the game a little bit better somehow.

Of course you could just delete your game and submit a new version but then
everyone who's bookmarked, liked, and played your game would lose that data.

This page explains how to do an "in-place" update to your game.

:::note
* You should only update your game if you have made moderate changes to it &mdash;
for example, bug fixes, usability enhancements and fixes, etc. If your new
version is substantially different, you should submit a new game. Your update
may not be approved if the updates are too substantial.
* If you've submitted a game that's not yet been approved but you want to make
changes to it before it is approved, just **delete** the game using the
archive icon (<Archive size={16}/>) and upload your new version as a new game.

## Steps

1.  On your profile,
click the pen icon (<PencilLine size={16} color={"#3B82F6"}/>) to the right
of the tabs. Then
click the **update/replace** icon (<Replace size={16}/>) to the right
of the game you wish to replace:

<div style={{
    display: "inline-block",
    border: "5px solid #FF69B4",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    margin: "10px"
}}>
    ![Approved Annotated](./img/approved-annotated.png)
</div>

2. Upload the new version of your game. (Note that you will not be able to
change the [aspect ratio](./device-dimensions#aspect-ratio) or description of your game.)

<div style={{
    display: "inline-block",
    border: "5px solid #FF69B4",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    margin: "10px"
}}>
    ![Replace](./img/replace.png)
</div>

3. Your new game version will then be **waiting moderation**. The current game version
will continue to serve for users until your new version is approved.

<div style={{
    display: "inline-block",
    border: "5px solid #FF69B4",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    margin: "10px"
}}>
    ![Replaced](./img/replaced.png)
</div>

4. Once your new version is approved, you'll see it reflected in your submitted
list:

<div style={{
    display: "inline-block",
    border: "5px solid #FF69B4",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    margin: "10px"
}}>
    ![Replaced Approved](./img/replaced-approved.png)
</div>
